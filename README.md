Boilerplate istanbul browserify karma phantomjs and mocha

## Synopsis

This is a boilerplate for browserify phantomjs karma and mocha.
This is not using gulp / grunt, adding this tasks runners depends on how many ambients you have to work for that particular project, so this only have an implementation in start file and then you can add gulp / grut in the way you need.

## Motivation

I would like better code by testing it with coverage reports. In order to have a more homogeneus code I would like to have my own boilerplate with everything needed to start.

## Installation

$ npm install

## Implementation

### Running tests

$ npm test

## API

No API here. Only front end development.
